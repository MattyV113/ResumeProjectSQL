## COVID Correlation Project

I always wondered what the correlation between COVID Deaths, and COVID Vaccination rates were not only in the US, but all over the world. I looked to answer this by finding a dataset from the Our World in Data site, and then proceeding to analyze this data through a number of SQL scripts in order to determine a number of different correlation factors pertaining to COVID Vaccination rates, and the COVID deaths associated with a particular country. 

I then took this data that was cleaned, filtered, and analyzed, and put together a Tableau Dashboard to better visualize these findings. 

I went on to see a strong correlation between the amount of deaths a country had, compared to their level of vaccination for COVID-19. A number of factors played into it as well like public health support and initiative, government funding towards equipment or vaccination sites, and overall attiude towards the vaccine can change these numbers. But, I was able to find answers to what I was looking for, and did so by going through the entire analytical process.
